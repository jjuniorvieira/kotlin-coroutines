# kotlin-coroutines
- why coroutines
  - allow us to write asynchronous code 
  - like JS asynchronous code in a single thread environment
- fork/join pool
  - to make app mult-thread 
- coroutines 
  - easier to read 
  - same as fork/join code 
  - there is a link between suspense functions and coroutines
- async programming 
  - callback 
  - future
    - easier than callback
  - coroutines
    - structure concurrency 
    - fluid code / natural code 
    - cancel work 
    - switch threads
  - virtual thread
    - similar to coroutines, added in java 21
- first coroutines
  - use the 'launch' coroutines builder
